## 🚫 .gitignore Notes (Important)

This project uses a `.gitignore` file to prevent committing build artifacts.

### Why bin/ and obj/ are ignored?
- These folders are auto-generated by .NET
- They are recreated every time you build or run
- They should NEVER be committed to Git

### Common ignored folders/files
- `bin/` – compiled output
- `obj/` – temporary build files
- `.vscode/` – editor settings
- `.idea/` – IDE files
- OS files like `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`

### If bin/ or obj/ are already committed
Run once:
```bash
git rm -r --cached bin obj

---

## ✅ Rules

- Commit every day (even tiny code)
- Difficulty does not matter
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- One commit per day is a win
